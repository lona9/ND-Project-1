# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Write a Data Science Blog Post

This repository contains the files created and used to analyze historical data of Chilean elections, to complete the first project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree: **Write a Data Science Blog Post**. 

-----
## Motivation
In light of the most recent presidential elections on Sunday 21, November, several questions were made after results proved to be quite surprising. The way people have voted in the past isn't a direct reflection of current events, but it could provide some helpful insight as to the possible pattern we might expect during the second round, and analyze this political event which no one seems indifferent to. Here, questions like how participation varies between rounds or how many votes have previous runners gained throughout the year are explored and visualized to inspire debate and further discussion.

## Installations
All the code is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, which requires the following libraries to run properly:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Files
There's 3 files contained in this repository:
- **resultados_elecciones_presidenciales_ce_1989_2017_Chile.xlsx**: historial election dataset obtained directly from the SERVEL website.
- **ELECCIONES 2021.xlsx**: 2021 election dataset gathered from information available on SERVEL website.
- **Write a Data Science Blog Post Project.ipynb**: This is where all the coding happens!

## Some takeaways
This analysis stems from a time of a lot of speculation and uncertainty, as all political processes prove to be. Chile has gone through polarized elections before, and historical data could provide some temporary answers and just food for thought while we wait for the second round in December. For this analysis, the historical dataset proved to be really powerful for a lot of different analysis, and could be even exploited further for regional or city analysis in a future occassion. We lacked complete data for this year's elections, which limited more specific analysis to compare with 2021 data. 

Even with those limitations, the national analysis gave some really interesting results: the voter turnout during second round of elections has been more or less the same than first round throughout the years (except for 2013), the amount of null and blank votes peaked when voting was mandatory but people could voluntarily register to vote, and has decreased slowly ever since 2012 when voting became voluntary; from 1989 to 2010, when voting sites were separated by gender, men voted more for the presidential winner than women, even considering the electoral rolls had more women than men for every year; and the change in votes for previous elections for current candidates was measured to estimate the growth for each candidate throughout the years.

All data was obtained either from prepared files or from different sources available in the SERVEL website.
